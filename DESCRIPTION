Description: Maximum likelihood estimation of Weibull component parameters in
    series systems from masked failure data. Implements the methodology from
    Towell (2023) "Reliability Estimation in Series Systems: Maximum Likelihood
    Techniques for Right-Censored and Masked Failure Data". Handles
    right-censored system lifetimes and masked component failure causes via
    candidate sets satisfying identifiability conditions. Provides log-likelihood,
    score, and Hessian functions along with multiple MLE solvers.
