## Examples

``` r
# fit the model
fit <- mle_numerical(mle_lbfgsb_wei_series_md_c1_c2_c3(
  df = guo_weibull_series_md$data,
  theta0 = c(1,1,1,1,1,1),
  control = list(
    maxit = 1000L,
    parscale = c(1, 1000, 1, 1000, 1, 1000))))

cbind(confint(fit),
  "fit" = params(fit),
  "guo mle" = guo_weibull_series_md$mle)
#>               2.5%       97.5%        fit  guo mle

# log-likelihood
c("guo log-like" = guo_weibull_series_md$loglike, "fit log-like" = loglik_val(fit))
#> guo log-like fit log-like 
#>    -228.6851    -228.6851
```

We see that they are approximately the same MLE fits.

``` r
shapes <- params(fit)[seq(1, length(params(fit)), 2)]
scales <- params(fit)[seq(2, length(params(fit)), 2)]
data.frame(
  "Component Cause" = wei_series_cause(1L:3L, shapes = shapes, scales = scales),
  "Component MTTF" = wei_mttf(shape = shapes, scale = scales))
#>   Component.Cause Component.MTTF

#> 3       0.3761829       803.5490

cat("System MTTF: ", wei_series_mttf(shapes = shapes, scales = scales))
#> System MTTF:  339.3773
```

## Brief Overview

This package implements a likelihood model for Weibull series systems
from masked data, including functions for the log-likelihood, score, and
hessian of the log-likelihood. Analytical solutions are provided for the
log-likelihood and score functions, while the hessian is computed
numerically. The package is designed to handle two types of data: masked
component cause of failure data with exact failure time and
right-censored system lifetime data.

The masked component data should approximately satisfy certain
conditions. The conditions are as follows:

#### Condition 1

The component cause of failure is in the candidate set.

#### Condition 2

When we condition on the component cause of failure being any particular
cause in the canidate set and and the time of failure, the probability
of the given candidate set does not vary as we vary the component cause
of failure.

#### Condition 3

The masking probabilities are independent of the series system lifetime
parameter vector.

### API

As a loglikelihood model, we provide the following functions:

  - `loglik_wei_series_md_c1_c2_c3` for the log-likelihood
  - `score_wei_series_md_c1_c2_c3` for the score function
  - `hessian_wei_series_md_c1_c2_c3` for the hessian of the
    log-likelihood

For convenience, we also provide some wrappers around the `optim`
function to solve for the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of the
shape and scale parameters using the Nelder-Mead and simulated annealing
algorithms:

  - `mle_nelder_wei_series_md_c1_c2_c3` for the Nelder-Mead algorithm
  - `mle_sann_wei_series_md_c1_c2_c3` for the simulated annealing
    algorithm

Since we base some of our results and analysis on Guo, Szidarovszky, and
Niu (2013), we provide the data set from their paper, along with the
maximum likelihood estimates of the shape and scale parameters for the
Weibull series system. We also provide a function to solve for the MLE
using the Nelder-Mead algorithm:

  - `guo_weibull_series_md` for a model that generates data similar to
    Guo, Szidarovszky, and Niu (2013)
  - `guo_weibull_series_table_2` for the data from Table 2 in Guo,
    Szidarovszky, and Niu (2013)

We also provide a host of supporting functions and data tables, e.g., we
provide Weibull series system distribution function that honors the
established conventions in R:

  - `dwei_series` for the probability density function
  - `pwei_series` for the cumulative distribution function
  - `qwei_series` for the quantile function
  - `rwei_series` for random number generation

We also provide functions to compute the mean time to failure and the
component cause of failure for the Weibull series distribution, along
with the hazard and survival functions:

  - `wei_series_mttf` for the mean time to failure
  - `wei_series_cause` for the component cause of failure
  - `hazard_wei_series` for the hazard function
  - `surv_wei_series` for the survival function (this is normally done
    by passing lower.tail = FALSE to `pwei_series` but we provide a
    function)

Finally, we also provide some functions for working with the components
of the Weibull series system, e.g., we provide a function to compute the
hazard function for the Weibull component lifetimes:

  - `hazard_wei` for the hazard function of the Weibull component
    lifetimes
  - `wei_mttf` for the mean time to failure of the Weibull component
    lifetimes
